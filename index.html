        <h1> Why i like video games </h1>
        <div class="line">
        </div>
        <p>I like video games because i find them fun. My favourite video games is Forza Horizon 4, it's basically just a car game where u dirve around and do challenges to earn money to buy more cars and that cycle repeats. My favourite car is the Mclaren p1 because it looks cool and can go very fast.My first car was a lancia which i used for a week and then earend a buch of new/expensive cars.</p>
